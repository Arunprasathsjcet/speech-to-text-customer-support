# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project implements a **Speech-to-Text (STT)** pipeline for automated transcription services using Python. It leverages pre-trained speech recognition models to convert audio input into accurate and readable text, making it useful for accessibility, content generation, and documentation purposes.

## 📌 Features

* Accepts audio inputs (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`)
* Transcribes audio to text using pretrained models
* Displays transcriptions in a readable format
* Can be extended for multi-language support
* Jupyter Notebook interface for easy experimentation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* `speech_recognition` library
* `pydub` for audio format handling
* Other standard Python libraries (`os`, `io`, etc.)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-transcription.git
   cd speech-to-text-transcription
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install optional dependencies:

   * FFmpeg (for `pydub` to work properly with `.mp3` files)

     ```bash
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in order.

3. Upload or specify the path to your audio file in the designated cell.

4. View the transcribed output in the notebook interface.

## 📂 Example

```python
from speech_recognition import Recognizer, AudioFile

recognizer = Recognizer()
with AudioFile('example.wav') as source:
    audio = recognizer.record(source)
    print(recognizer.recognize_google(audio))
```

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Support for real-time audio streaming
* Integration with Whisper or other advanced models
* Multi-speaker diarization
* Language detection and translation
